PROJECT NAME:
	Team 404

BUSINESS CONTEXT:
	Social media app marketed to professionals or hobbyists alike, for the purpose of learning.
	Place to share common interests, where people can ask questions, share interests, create posts and make friends.
	Feed personalized to their interests.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
	Most social media apps are cluttered. Users' feeds are flooded with random videos and it can often be disorientating.
	Although some apps are designed with algorithms to prevent this and to show the user what they think they would like,
	they still do not remain loyal to this concept 100% of the time.
	
	Our software is designed to show the user exactly what they want to see, and they can choose when they see it.
	It filters out other topics so the user sees what they choose using tags.
	
SCOPE:
	Will be avaible on desktop and mobile if time permits.
	Limit the number of tags, about 3 to start.
	Limit the size of uploads.

ASSUMPTIONS:
	The app will be used on all if not most devices. User name will be different than the log in name, with the ability to choose display name.

FEATURES:
	Feed curated using tags.
	Secure login.
	Search bar.
	Follow system.

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIRMENTS:
    The app/site will have the need for little monitoring.
